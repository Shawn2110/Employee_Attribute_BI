**Employee Attrition Prediction & BI Dashboard**   

This project provides a complete pipeline for analyzing employee data, training a Machine Learning model to predict attrition, and presenting the insights through an interactive Streamlit Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard. 

Project Goal    
The primary goal is to accurately predict which employees are likely to leave the company (attrition) and identify the key factors contributing to turnover. This allows HR and management to intervene proactively and improve retention strategies.
Repository Structure
The project includes the following core files:

1. WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv - The raw dataset containing 1,470 employee records and 35 attributes.
2. Attrition_Prediction.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook containing the core Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning model training (Random Forest).
3. Attrition_Prediction_With_BI.ipynb - An expanded notebook similar to the above, which also includes steps for exporting the final predictions for the BI dashboard.
4. attrition_predictions.csv - The output file generated by the ML notebook. It contains the original data plus the model's attrition predictions (Attrition_Prediction) and confidence scores (Attrition_Prob).
5. dashboard.py - The Python script that runs the Streamlit interactive dashboard.


**Machine Learning Model Details**
The project focuses on building a robust classification model using Python's scikit-learn library.


Model Pipeline

1. Preprocessing: Categorical variables were one-hot encoded. Irrelevant columns (EmployeeCount, StandardHours, Over18, EmployeeNumber) were dropped.  
2. Model Selection: Both Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers were tested.  
3. Final Model: The Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its superior performance (achieving an accuracy of approximately 86.85% on the test set). 

Key Features for Attrition Prediction

The Random Forest model identified the following features as the most important predictors of attrition (typically shown in the notebook's final plot):  
MonthlyIncome  
OverTime  
JobRole  
Age  
JobSatisfaction  
TotalWorkingYears  


**Interactive BI Dashboard (Streamlit)**  

The dashboard.py script utilizes the attrition_predictions.csv file to launch an interactive dashboard for visualizing results.
Key Metrics (KPIs)  

The dashboard presents the following high-level insights:
Overall Attrition Rate (Predicted)  
Average Monthly Income  
Count of High-Risk Employees (Attrition Probability > 70%)  
Visualizations  
Income vs. Satisfaction: An interactive scatter plot exploring the relationship between MonthlyIncome and JobSatisfaction, colored by the predicted attrition status.  
High-Risk Table: A detailed table listing employees identified as the highest risk for attrition, ordered by their predicted probability.  

How to Run the Dashboard
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, plotly) installed.   
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit plotly plotly-express   
Generate Predictions: Run the Attrition_Prediction_With_BI.ipynb notebook completely to generate the required attrition_predictions.csv file.  
Launch Streamlit: Run the dashboard script from your terminal:  
streamlit run dashboard.py  

This will open the interactive dashboard in your default web browser.
